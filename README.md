# Whats a DDOS
DDoS is an abbreviation of Distributed Denial of Service or in Indonesian it can be interpreted as a Distributed Denial of Service. DDoS is a type of attack that is carried out by flooding internet network traffic on servers, systems, or networks. Generally, this attack is carried out using several attacker's host computer until the target computer cannot be accessed.
DDoS is a very popular attack used by hackers. In addition to having many types, DDoS has a very simple concept, namely making server traffic run with a heavy load until it can no longer accommodate connections from other users (overload). One way is to send requests to the server continuously with large data transactions.
